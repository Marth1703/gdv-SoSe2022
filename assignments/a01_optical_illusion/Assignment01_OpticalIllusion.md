# GDV SoSe 2022 - Assignment #01 - Optical illusion

## Task
Implement an optical illusion using Python and OpenCV, record an image or a video of the resulting application and write a readme file that explains how to run the script and what it does (about 200 words, German or English).

## Hints
See [this video](./video_illusion.mp4) as exemplary solution and check out [this page](http://www.psy.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/kosaku2e.html) as an inspiration.

## Rating
- Load an image with a color gradient. (1 point)
  - **Alternative:** Generate an image with an appropriate color gradient. (2 points)
- Copy some shape from the center of the image and draw the shape in darker and brighter regions. (2 points)
- Move the shape around in the image. (2 points)
- Record a video of the illusion. (2 point)
  - **Alternative:** Save an image showing the illusion. (1 point)
- Code is well readable, structured and documented. And it can be well explained in the consultation. (up to 2 points)
- Code fullfils the [PEP8 styleguide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). (1 point)
- Readme is well written and helpful. It contains all used modules and their version. (1 point)

## Acceptance criteria
- Hand in code (.py file), resulting image or video (some appropriate file format) and short explanation (readme.md file) either as one zip file or as a link to a public github respository via FELIX. If you use a Github link, please create a tag of the final version before the deadline.
- Illusion effect visible in either the image or video
- From the source code, it is clearly visible that the pixel values are not altered.
- The code is written mainly on your own and any other source is mentioned in the code. If two groups hand in the same or extremely similar solution, both groups do not pass the assignment.

## Pass criteria
- The assignment is passed, if 5 or more points are reached.
